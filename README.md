# Telecom Customer Behaviour and Churn Analysis EDA.

### Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecommunications industry, directly impacting revenue and long-term growth. This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a telecommunications customer dataset to uncover patterns in customer demographics, subscription plans, device usage, satisfaction levels, and churn behavior.

The goal is to generate data-driven insights that can help a telecom company—such as MTN—understand why customers leave, identify high-risk customer segments, and recommend strategies to improve retention and revenue.

### Business Problem

The telecom company has observed a steady increase in customer churn. Management seeks answers to the following questions:

- Why are customers churning? 

- Which customer segments are most likely to leave?

- How do satisfaction, tenure, and data usage influence churn?

- Which subscription plans generate the most revenue?

- What actionable steps can reduce churn and improve customer lifetime value?

This EDA addresses these questions using structured data analysis and visual storytelling.

### Data Sources
CustomerChurn Data: the main dataset used for this analysis is the "customerchurn.csv" file, containing detailed information about different customers goteen from kaggle.com

### Tools & Technologies

- Python
  
- Pandas – data manipulation
  
- NumPy – Numerical analysis
  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
  
- Jupyter Notebook – Analysis environment

### Exploratory Data Analysis Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
   
- Converted date columns to datetime format

- Handled missing values in reviews and satisfaction scores

- Standardized categorical values

- Removed duplicate records

3. Univariate Analysis
   
- Age distribution

- Gender distribution

- Customer tenure distribution

- Data usage distribution

- Revenue distribution

4. Bivariate Analysis
   
- Churn vs satisfaction rate

- Churn vs data usage

- Revenue vs subscription plan

- Churn vs age group

6. Churn Analysis
   
- Overall churn rate

- Churn rate by subscription plan

- Churn rate by demographic segments
